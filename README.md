# MNIST-Digits-Classification-Tensorflow-Keras

# Overview

This project demonstrates a simple and effective workflow for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using a neural network built with TensorFlow's Keras API. The MNIST dataset consists of grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9), making it a classic problem in computer vision and machine learning.

The model uses a single hidden layer for learning features and achieves high accuracy on the test set, making it a great example for beginners to understand neural networks.

# Features

    * Dataset: Uses the MNIST dataset, which contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images.
     * Data Preprocessing: Includes normalization and flattening of image data for neural network input.
    * Model Architecture: A simple feedforward neural network with one hidden layer of 32 neurons and an output layer of 10 neurons.
     * Training and Evaluation: Model is trained for 20 epochs, and its performance is evaluated on a test dataset.
    * Visualization: Includes functions to display sample images and plot training loss over epochs.

# Technologies Used

    * Python: Programming language.
    * TensorFlow (Keras): For building and training the neural network.
    * NumPy: For numerical operations.
    * Matplotlib: For data visualization.
